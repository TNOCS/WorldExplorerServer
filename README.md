# WorldExplorerServer

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/e49704eff12243549c7aa95d77f143ea)](https://www.codacy.com/app/erikvullings/world-explorer-server?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=TNOCS/world-explorer-server&utm_campaign=badger)

Tile server proxy for WorldExplorer, serving cached Mapzen vector tiles, or your own GeoJSON tiles. 
In addition, when running on port 10733 (requirement of Unity), it can serve as an assetbundle server too.

Features:
- Serve GeoJSON as tiles from the cache folder (folder can be configured in `config.json`). For example, when requesting [http://localhost:10733/buildings,roads,landuse,places,pois/17/67530/43625.json](http://localhost:10733/buildings,roads,landuse,places,pois/17/67530/43625.json), a JSON object is returned containing the keys `buildings`, `roads` etc. whose value is a GeoJSON feature collection.
- Download GeoJSON tiles from Mapzen if not in cache (API key needs to be configured in download url in `config.json`)
- Serve asset bundles from the `assets` folder (Unity5 does not seem to allow port numbers in asset bundle URLs, so either serve them via FTP, the Unity asset server, or run this application locally on port 10733). Read more [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SettinguptheAssetServer.html) and [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/team-license).
- Specify your own assets as a GeoJSON FeatureCollection in `assets.json`. Each point feature in this GeoJSON is loaded, and served as tile to WorldExplorer (key = 'assets').

```json
{
    "geometry": {
      "type": "Point",
      "coordinates": [5.479269,51.436914]
    },
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
      "asset": "catharina kerk",
      "remove_from": "buildings",
      "name": "Catharina kerk",
      "min_zoom": 16,
      "id": 271573902,
      "bundle": "http://localhost/buildings/eindhoven"
    }
  }
  ```
    - `coordinates`: where to place the 3D model
    - `asset`: name of the asset in the asset bundle (see below to read how to create your own asset bundle)
    - `remove_from`: name of the GeoJSON collection in the exported tile where we should remove an item from, e.g. the original building. Can be a string or array of strings.
    - `min_zoom` and `max_zoom`: when the requested zoom level is outside of these bounds, ignore this asset.
    - `id`: when iterating through all `remove_from` collections, remove all items that have this id.
    - `bundle`: URL of the asset bundle server and endpoint (points to the `assets` folder).

## Configuration
Before you can serve tiles, you need to [obtain a valid Mapzen key](https://mapzen.com/developers) and add it to `config.json` url value. 

## Installation
Assuming that you have a working node.js version installed, you also need to install `typescript` (`npm i typescript -g`) and `typings` (`npm i typings -g`). Now you can go to the folder and, install the dependencies with:

```console
npm install
typings install
```

Transpile the Typescript code to Javascript code in `dist` using
```console
tsc
```

And finally, run the server from the `dist` folder with:
```console
node dist\server.js
```
